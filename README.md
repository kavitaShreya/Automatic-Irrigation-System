# Automatic Irrigation System
In the Field of Agriculture, use of proper method of Irrigation System is important and it is well known that Irrigation is very economical and efficient.  Farmer has to keep watch on Irrigation timetable, which is different for different crops. The project makes the the Irrigation automated. With the use of low cost sensors and the simple circuitry makes these project a low cost product, which can be even bought by a poor Farmer. 
## Based on
This system is basically based on microcontroller which requires 5v to activate, which contain two default condition i.e. motor is on when dry state, and motor is off in wet state. The dry and wet state of soil is measured by a Soil Sensor connected with a comparator. All process will be done automatically.
## Advancements
There are two advancements, one is reverse process that will show the whole operation to check the condition is in either dry state or wet state and the 2nd is there is a buzzer to alert that ground is full of water. The main motor is used to pump the water to the field. The power source is given by 2 battery each of 4 volts or we can apply the AC to activate the circuit.
